# WPF_Demo
This was made for SQL Class.
This software was written by Ben Zadow and Alex Watt. The software can currently do three querying tasks on our data. 1. Finding names of players that is similar to what was typed in. 2. Finding teams that have ratings at the number typed in or higher 3. Finding teams that have more wins than the team the user selected. More things are in the process!
